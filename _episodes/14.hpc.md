title: "High performance containers"
teaching: 15
exercises: 15
questions:
- How can I run an MPI enabled application in a container using a bind approach?
- How can I run a GPU enabled application in a container?
objectives:
- Discuss the bind approach for containerised MPI applications, including its performance
- Get started with containerised GPU applications
- Run-real world MPI/GPU examples using OpenFoam, Gromacs and Tensorflow
keypoints:
- Appropriate Singularity environment variables can be used to configure the bind approach for MPI containers (sys admins can help); Shifter achieves this via a configuration file
- Singularity and Shifter interface almost transparently with HPC schedulers such as Slurm
- MPI performance of containerised applications almost coincide with those of a native run
- You can run containerised GPU applications with Singularity using the flags `--nv` or `--rocm` for Nvidia or AMD GPUs, respectively

**NOTE**: the following hands-on session focuses on Singularity only.


### Configure the MPI/interconnect bind approach

Before we start, let us cd to the `openfoam` example directory
and adjust the PATH: 

```bash
cd ~/isc-tutorial/exercises/openfoam
OLDPATH=PATH
PATH=/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/bin:$PATH
```

Now, suppose you have an MPI installation in your host and a containerised MPI application, built upon MPI libraries that are ABI compatible with the former.  

For this tutorial, we do have MPICH installed on the host machine:

```bash
which mpirun
```
```output
/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/bin/mpirun
```

and we're going to pull an OpenFoam container, which was built on top of MPICH as well:

```bash
singularity pull library://marcodelapierre/beta/openfoam:v2012
```

Note that this image has already been pulled on the tutorial VMs.  OpenFoam comes with a collection of executables, one of which is `simpleFoam`.  We can use the Linux command `ldd` to investigate the libraries that this executable links to.  As `simpleFoam` links to a few tens of libraries, let's specifically look for MPI (`libmpi*`) libraries in the command output:

```bash
singularity exec openfoam_v2012.sif bash -c 'ldd $(which simpleFoam) |grep libmpi'
```
```output
libmpi.so.12 => /usr/lib/libmpi.so.12 (0x00007fa0836e6000)
```

This is the container MPI installation that was used to build OpenFoam.

How do we setup a bind approach to make use of the host MPI installation?  
We can make use of Singularity-specific environment variables, to make these host libraries available in the container (see location of MPICH from `which mpirun` above):

```bash
export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/opt/intel/oneapi"
export SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib:/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib/libfabric:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

Note the "escaping" of the dollar sign at the end. This is to keep the explicit name of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within the definition (and not the evaluation of its value in the host).

> ## Display the variables
>  So the environment variable looks like this in the host:
> ```bash
>  echo $SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> ```
> ``` output
> /opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib:/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib/libfabric:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> ```
>  Then, the evaluation of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within the container has, at the beginning, the additional path for the libraries in the host (as intended). And the rest is the original definition of the variable within the container (as intended).
> ```bash
>  singularity exec openfoam_v2012.sif bash -c 'echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH'

{: .solution}

Now, if we inspect `mpirun` dynamic linking again:

```bash
singularity exec openfoam_v2012.sif bash -c 'ldd $(which simpleFoam) |grep libmpi'
```
```output
libmpi.so.12 => /opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib/libmpi.so.12 (0x00007f34aa9e3000)
```

Now OpenFoam is picking up the host MPI libraries!

Note that, on a HPC cluster, with the same mechanism it is possible to expose the host interconnect libraries in the container, to achieve maximum communication performance.


### Let's run OpenFoam in a container!

To get the real feeling of running an MPI application in a container, let's run a practical example.  
We're using OpenFoam, a widely popular package for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, which is able to massively scale in parallel architectures up to thousands of processes, by leveraging an MPI library.  
The sample inputs come straight from the OpenFoam installation tree, namely `$FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/pimpleFoam/LES/periodicHill/steadyState/`.

Before getting started, let's make sure that no previous output file is present in the exercise directory:

```bash
./clean-outputs.sh
```

Now, let's execute the script in the current directory:

```bash
./mpirun.sh
```

This will take a few minutes to run.  In the end, you will get the following output files/directories:

```bash
ls -ltr
```
```output

-rw-r--r--. 1 tutorial livetau       1533 Nov  4 22:06 log.reconstructPar
```

We ran using *2 MPI* processes, who created outputs in the directories `processor0` and `processor1`, respectively.  
The final reconstruction creates results in the directory `20` (which stands for the *20th* and last simulation step in this very short demo run), as well as the output file `log.reconstructPar`.

As execution proceeds, let's ask ourselves: what does running singularity with MPI look run in the script?  Here's the script we're executing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NTASKS="2"
image="library://marcodelapierre/beta/openfoam:v2012"

# this configuration depends on the host
export MPICH_ROOT="/opt/intel/oneapi"
export MPICH_LIBS="$( which mpirun )"
export MPICH_LIBS="${MPICH_LIBS%/bin/mpirun*}/lib"

export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="$MPICH_ROOT"
export SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MPICH_LIBS:$MPICH_LIBS/libfabric:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"



# pre-processing
singularity exec $image \
  blockMesh | tee log.blockMesh

singularity exec $image \
  topoSet | tee log.topoSet

singularity exec $image \
  decomposePar -fileHandler uncollated | tee log.decomposePar


# run OpenFoam with MPI
mpirun -n $NTASKS \
  singularity exec $image \
  simpleFoam -fileHandler uncollated -parallel | tee log.simpleFoam


# post-processing
singularity exec $image \
  reconstructPar -latestTime -fileHandler uncollated | tee log.reconstructPar
```

In the beginning, Singularity variable `SINGULARITY_BINDPATH` and `SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are defined to setup the bind approach for MPI.  
Then, a bunch of OpenFoam commands are executed, with only one being parallel:

```bash
mpirun -n $NTASKS \
  singularity exec $image \
  simpleFoam -fileHandler uncollated -parallel | tee log.simpleFoam
```

That's as simple as prepending `mpirun` to the `singularity` command line, as for any other MPI application.


### Singularity interface to Slurm

Now, have a look at the script variant for the Slurm scheduler, `slurm_pawsey.sh`:

```bash
srun -n $SLURM_NTASKS \
  singularity exec $image \
  simpleFoam -fileHandler uncollated -parallel | tee log.simpleFoam
```

The key difference is that every OpenFoam command is executed via `srun`, *i.e.* the Slurm wrapper for the MPI launcher, `mpirun`.  Other schedulers will require a different command.  
In practice, all we had to do was to replace `mpirun` with `srun`, as for any other MPI application.


### Bonus: a second OpenFoam example with visual output

If time allows, you may want to try out a second simulation, which models the air flow around a two-dimensional wing profile.  This example has been kindly contributed by Alexis Espinosa at Pawsey Centre.  
The required setup is as follows (a Slurm setup is also available in the alternate directory `slurm_pawsey`):

```bash
cd ~/isc-tutorial/exercises/openfoam_wing/mpirun
./mpirun.sh
```

This run uses 4 MPI processes and takes about 5-6 minutes.  Upon completion, the file `wingMotion2D_pimpleFoam/wingMotion2D_pimpleFoam.foam` can be opened with the visualisation package *Paraview*, which is available for this training.  
To launch Paraview, use your web browser to open the page `https://tut<XXX>.supercontainers.org:8443/#e4s`, and login with your training account details.  Once you have got the Linux desktop, open up a terminal window and execute `paraview`.  Use the `File Open` menu to find and open the `.foam` file mentioned above.  Finally, follow the presenter's instructions to visualise the simulation box.  Here are a couple of snapshots:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/wing_p_pressure.png" alt="Wing pressure map" width="400"/></th>
    <th><img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/wing_nut_viscosity.png" alt="Wing viscosity map" width="400"/></th> 
  </tr>
</table>

We have just visualised the results of this containerised simulation!


### DEMO: Container *vs* bare-metal MPI performance

NOTE: this part was executed on the Pawsey Zeus cluster.  You can follow the outputs here.

Pawsey Centre provides a set of MPI base images, which also ship with the OSU Benchmark Suite.  Let's use it to get a feel of what it's like to use or *not* to use the high-speed interconnect.  
We're going to run a small bandwidth benchmark using the image `quay.io/pawsey/mpich-base:3.1.4_ubuntu18.04`.  All of the required commands can be found in the directory path of the first OpenFoam example, in the script `benchmark_pawsey.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH --job-name=mpi
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --time=00:20:00

image="docker://quay.io/pawsey/mpich-base:3.1.4_ubuntu18.04"
osu_dir="/usr/local/libexec/osu-micro-benchmarks/mpi"

# this configuration depends on the host
module unload xalt
module load singularity


# see that SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH is defined (host MPI/interconnect libraries)
echo $SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# 1st test, with host MPI/interconnect libraries
srun singularity exec $image \
  $osu_dir/pt2pt/osu_bw -m 1024:1048576


# unset SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
unset SINGULARITYENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# 2nd test, without host MPI/interconnect libraries
srun singularity exec $image \
  $osu_dir/pt2pt/osu_bw -m 1024:1048576
```

Basically we're running the test twice, the first time using the full bind approach configuration as provided by the `singularity` module on the cluster, and the second time after unsetting the variable that makes the host MPI/interconnect libraries available in containers.

Here is the first output (using the interconnect):

```output
# OSU MPI Bandwidth Test v5.4.1
# Size      Bandwidth (MB/s)
1024                 2281.94
2048                 3322.45
4096                 3976.66
8192                 5124.91
16384                5535.30
32768                5628.40
65536               10511.64
131072              11574.12
262144              11819.82
524288              11933.73
1048576             12035.23
```

And here is the second one:

```output
# OSU MPI Bandwidth Test v5.4.1
# Size      Bandwidth (MB/s)
1024                   74.47
2048                   93.45
4096                  106.15
8192                  109.57
16384                 113.79
32768                 116.01
65536                 116.76
131072                116.82
262144                117.19
524288                117.37
1048576               117.44
```

Well, you can see that for a 1 MB message, the bandwidth is 12 GB/s versus 100 MB/s, quite a significant difference in performance!

<!--
For your information, here are some more communication benchmark figures, comparing bare-metal vs container scenarios:

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/OSU_Latency_Coll.png" alt="OSU collective latency test" width="651" height="489"/>

As you can see, the difference is negligible!

### DEMO: Run a deep learning distributed training on GPUs with containers

NOTE: this part was executed on the Pawsey Topaz cluster with Nvidia GPUs.  You can follow the outputs here.

For our example we are going to use Tensorflow, a quite popular deep learning package, among the ones that have been optimised to run on GPUs through Nvidia containers.  
To start, let us cd to the `tensorflow` example directory:

```bash
cd ~/isc-tutorial/exercises/tensorflow
```

This example uses the model described in the Tensorflow tutorials for distributed training using Keras: [Distributed training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/keras). The model uses the [`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MirroredStrategy) to perform in-graph replication with synchronous training on many GPUs on one node, and has been defined in the python script: `distributedMNIST.py` . As the name of the script suggests, it uses the classical MNIST dataset, which is used to train a model to recognise handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

Now, from a Singularity perspective, all we need to do to run a GPU application on Nvidia GPUs from a container is to add the runtime flag `--nv`.  This will make Singularity look for the Nvidia GPU driver and libraries in the host, and mount them inside the container.  Hence, when running GPU applications through Singularity, the only requirement on the host system side is a working installation of the Nvidia drivers and libraries for the GPU card (the driver is typically called `libcuda.so.<VERSION>`). All of these are normally located in some library subdirectory of `/usr`.

Finally, GPU resources are usually made available in HPC systems through schedulers, to which Singularity natively and transparently interfaces.  So, for instance let us have a look in the current directory at the Slurm batch script called `gpu_pawsey.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l

#SBATCH --job-name=tf_distributed
#SBATCH --partition=gpuq
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00

###---Singularity settings
theImage="docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:22.04-tf2-py3"
module load singularity

###---Python script containing the training procedure
theScript="distributedMNIST.py"


###---Launching the distributed tensorflow case
srun singularity exec --nv -e -B fake_home:$HOME $theImage python $theScript
```

Here the key aspect is to combine the Slurm command `srun` with `singularity exec --nv <..>` (similar to what we did in the episode on MPI):

```bash
srun singularity exec --nv $image python <..>
```

In addition, we ask for all the GPUs available in a single node (2 in this case), along with a single master task. The distribution of work and communication among the GPUS is managed by Tensorflow through the Nvidia toolkit. But what really concerns to this training is the meaning of the various runtime options that are added to the `singularity` command:
- `--nv` has already been explained above.
- `-e` avoids the propagation of any environment variable of the host towards the container (except for those explicilty defined through Singularity-specific syntax). This is the recommended way to execute any Python container in order to avoid contamination of the internal Python environment (see previous episode for more information).
- `-B fake_home:$HOME` this is also related to best practices for containerised Python. For this application, Python tries to download the MNIST dataset into the user's home directory, which is often not bind mounted by default by the system administrators, therefore generating an error when attempting to write the files. To solve this issue, we do not recommend to bind mount the home directory for containers execution. Instead, we recommend to use an auxiliary directory (called `fake_home` in this case) and bind mount it as the container `$HOME`. In this way, Python applications will write into this auxiliary directory instead of the real home.

We can submit the script with:

```bash
sbatch gpu_pawsey.sh
```

If on Perlmutter, you can submit the corresponding script instead, specifying your NERSC project name:

```bash
sbatch -A <NERSC-project> gpu_perlmutter.sh
```

Several outputs are produced, including the directories `training_checkpoints`, `saved_model`, `logs` and, as mentioned above, the dataset and other Python files hidden output under the `fake_home`.

```bash
ls -ltr
```
```output
